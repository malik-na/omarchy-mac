# Omarchy Mac installation steps

_Disclaimer: This guide is intended for Apple Silicon Macs M1/M2. It is advised that you follow the instructions very carefully lest you risk bricking the Mac or getting stuck in a Boot Loop (I will provide a fix for that as well in the end)._

## Step 1: Install Arch minimal from Asahi Alarm

Visit [https://asahi-alarm.org/](https://asahi-alarm.org/) and run the following script in your Terminal to start Asahi Alarm Installer:

```bash
curl https://asahi-alarm.org/installer-bootstrap.sh | sh
```

Once inside the Asahi Alarm Installer, please follow the on-screen instructions (very carefully). A few recommendations:

- Ideally, you should have at least `50 GB` available on your SSD that you can dedicate to the Linux partition.
- Choose `Asahi Arch Minimal` from the list of OS options the installer provides.

## Step 2: Initial Arch Linux Setup

After installation, boot into Arch Linux and perform the initial setup:

1. **Log into root** - username and password: `root`
2. **Configure wifi** - Run `nmtui` for network setup (if you get an error after activating your wifi, reboot)
3. **Update system** - Run `pacman -Syu`
4. **Install essential packages** - Run `pacman -S sudo git base-devel neovim chromium`
5. **Set locale** - Run `nano /etc/locale.gen` and uncomment `en_US.UTF-8`, save and exit.
Run `locale-gen`, `nano /etc/locale.conf` and it should show `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`, if it doesn't, change it. 
Now run `locale` and then `reboot` .

## Step 3: Create User Account

Create a new user account and configure sudo access:

1. **Create user** - `useradd -m -G wheel <username>`
2. **Set password** - `passwd <username>`
3. **Configure sudo** - `EDITOR=nano visudo`
4. **Enable wheel group** - Uncomment `%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
5. **Save and exit** - Ctrl O, Enter, Ctrl X
6. **Switch to new user** - `su - <username>`

## Step 4: Install AUR Helper and Omarchy Mac

As your new user, set up the AUR helper and install Omarchy Mac:

1. **Install yay AUR helper**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
   cd yay
   makepkg -si
   ```

2. **Clone and setup Omarchy Mac**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/malik-na/omarchy-mac.git ~/.local/share/omarchy
   cd ~/.local/share/omarchy
   bash install.sh
   ```

   And you're done! Now, please wait for the installation to complete and enter password when required.

**Note**: If mirrors break during installation, run `bash fix-mirrors.sh` then run `install.sh` again.


## Omarchy Mac Menu

Omarchy Mac now includes the **Omarchy Mac Menu** by default, which replaces Walker with fuzzel for better aarch64 compatibility and performance. The menu system uses fuzzel as the frontend while maintaining all the original functionality.

Key improvements:
- Better performance on aarch64 systems (Apple Silicon Macs)
- Fuzzel-based frontend for improved stability
- Maintains all original omarchy menu functionality
- Automatic migration from walker-based setup


## Mirrorlist updates

Omarchy may provide a recommended mirrorlist during install, but it will not silently overwrite an existing system mirrorlist. The installer and helper scripts follow a safe default:


If you want to force a full overwrite you can either run the helper with `--force` and/or `--backup` to keep a timestamped backup, or set the environment variable `OMARCHY_FORCE_MIRROR_OVERWRITE=1` during install.

## Changes since v0.1.0

A few notable improvements have been added since v0.1.0. These are safe, tested, and meant to make installation and first-run smoother on Apple Silicon (ARM) systems:

- ARM mirror enhancements
   - Auto-detects country (from timezone) and tests mirrors before applying.
   - Supports many more regional mirrors with primary/fallback entries and connectivity checks.
   - Runs automatically during the Omarchy preflight on aarch64 systems and creates backups by default.
   - Files: `install/helpers/set-arm-mirrors.sh`, `install/preflight/arm-mirrors.sh`, `install/preflight/all.sh`, `install/helpers/all.sh`.

- Timezone detection & setup
   - Automatic timezone detection (IP-based via `tzupdate`) with confirmation and graceful fallbacks.
   - Interactive/manual selection, first-run reminders, and Waybar/menu integration for easy updates.
   - New commands: `bin/omarchy-cmd-tzupdate-enhanced`, `bin/omarchy-cmd-tzupdate-manual`.
   - Files: `install/config/timezone-detection.sh`, `install/first-run/timezone.sh`, `install/config/timezones.sh`, and related menu/waybar wiring.

- Menu & UX
   - The Omarchy Mac Menu has moved to a `fuzzel` frontend for improved aarch64 stability and performance.
   - Menu now exposes timezone and update helpers for easier access.

- Mirrorlist & safety
   - Mirrorlist handling is conservative: the installer merges recommended servers into existing `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` by default and only overwrites when explicitly requested (or when `OMARCHY_FORCE_MIRROR_OVERWRITE=1` is set).
   - A `fix-mirrors.sh` helper is available to repair mirror issues during install.

These changes are additive and intended to preserve existing workflows while improving reliability for new installs.
